## Quick Intro
I am a casual academic and [Graduate Research](http://www.gamesstudio.org/profiles/fiza-mughal) student at the [University of Technology Sydney - UTS](https://www.uts.edu.au/). My [research](http://www.gamesstudio.org/projects/autonomous-monitoring-system-geriatric-persons) is focused on detecting depression in geriatric people using smart wearables under the supervision of  [Dr. Jaime Garcia](http://www.gamesstudio.org/profiles/jaime-garcia) and [Dr. William Raffe](http://www.gamesstudio.org/profiles/william-l-raffe). I also tutor 1st year engineering and computer science students in Python and Java for Programming Fundamentals and advanced Programming 1. As a developer, I've assisted academics in the Faculty of Health with technical application development for clinical studies and educational mobile applications.

I got my Bachelors (Hons) in Information Technology at [Sunway University](https://university.sunway.edu.my/) in Malaysia as a dual degree with [Lancaster University](https://www.lancaster.ac.uk/), following which I worked at a tech firm for a few years. During the gap between work and my post graduate studies, I worked on freelance web development and management projects.
